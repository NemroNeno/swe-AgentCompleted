Your task is to pin-point those files with line numbers from the repository that are likely to cause that issue.\n\nProblem Statement: Inconsistency when simplifying (-a)**x * a**(-x), a a positive integer\nCompare:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> a = Symbol('a', integer=True, positive=True)\r\n>>> e = (-a)**x * a**(-x)\r\n>>> f = simplify(e)\r\n>>> print(e)\r\na**(-x)*(-a)**x\r\n>>> print(f)\r\n(-1)**x\r\n>>> t = -S(10)/3\r\n>>> n1 = e.subs(x,t)\r\n>>> n2 = f.subs(x,t)\r\n>>> print(N(n1))\r\n-0.5 + 0.866025403784439*I\r\n>>> print(N(n2))\r\n-0.5 + 0.866025403784439*I\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> a = S(2)\r\n>>> e = (-a)**x * a**(-x)\r\n>>> f = simplify(e)\r\n>>> print(e)\r\n(-2)**x*2**(-x)\r\n>>> print(f)\r\n(-1)**x\r\n>>> t = -S(10)/3\r\n>>> n1 = e.subs(x,t)\r\n>>> n2 = f.subs(x,t)\r\n>>> print(N(n1))\r\n0.5 - 0.866025403784439*I\r\n>>> print(N(n2))\r\n-0.5 + 0.866025403784439*I\r\n```\n\n\nHint: More succinctly, the problem is\r\n```\r\n>>> (-2)**(-S(10)/3)\r\n-(-2)**(2/3)/16\r\n```\r\nPow is supposed to use the principal branch, which means (-2) has complex argument pi, which under exponentiation becomes `-10*pi/3` or equivalently `2*pi/3`. But the result of automatic simplification is different: its argument is -pi/3. \r\n\r\nThe base (-1) is handled correctly, though.\r\n```\r\n>>> (-1)**(-S(10)/3)\r\n(-1)**(2/3)\r\n```\r\nHence the inconsistency, because the simplified form of the product has (-1) in its base. \n\nUse tool calls only if necessary. You are only allowed to use one most appropriate tool at a time. Call the tool you think is the most appropriate one and let the tols supply its output to the next agent. The next agent will continue to use more tools as necessary.\n                                                        \nRemember to only use one most appropriate tool. If you don't know about the directories or files in the current directories, use 'ls' tool to list them.                          \n\nOnly provide the file paths and the line numbers that are the cause of this issue in the format:\nFile: ...
